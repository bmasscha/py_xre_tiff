# Project xre tiff read and write

## Information
This project is a python library to read and write xre tiff images.
The xre tiff images are normal tiff files but the format is simple.
The description tag can contain the image slope and offset.
In the example folder, there are tiff files for you to test on
The data is always saved after a eight bytes. These first bytes contain the size of the image if I am correct.
That means that in principle you can just read the data immediatly after you have read the size. 
The data format is mostly sixteen bit little endian. Maybe that is also specified in the first 8 bits. 

## The functions
### Read tiff
A first function to be created is read_xre_tif(path, data, rescale=False). 
The rescale is there if we want to apply the conversion from the U16 data to float data based on the slope and the offset in the description tag. 

### Write tiff
The second function is write_xre_tif(path, data, rescale=False, slope=1.0, offset=0.0)
Of course this function is used to save data in the xre format. Again the same eight bytes header and then the data. In the description tag we write
slope = 1.000000E+00 offset = 0.000000E+01
If rescale is True we have to rescale the float input data according to the specified slope and offset values. Convert to U16 and save the tiff file and the tags.
If the rescale is False, we convert the float data into U16 without using the slope and offset but the slope and offset values are written in the description tag.
All tags are written after the data.
